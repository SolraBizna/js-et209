This is an emulator for the (fictional) ET-209 digital synthesizer chip, which was used in the (fictional) Eiling Technologies Artificial Reality System, which was an overengineered, overpriced, overheating 8-bit game console (fictionally) released in the late 80's.

The ET209 is documented [here](https://github.com/SolraBizna/ars-emu/blob/master/HARDWARE.md#apu).
