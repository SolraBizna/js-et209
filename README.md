This is an emulator for the (fictional) ET-209 digital synthesizer chip, which was used in the (fictional) Eiling Technologies Artificial Reality System, which was an overengineered, overpriced, overheating 8-bit game console (fictionally) released in the late 80's.

At the time of this writing, documentation for the ET-209 (and the ARS in general) has not been publicly released. That'll change when the platform is mature enough, and the emulator and development tools are released. Until then, have a blob of code.
